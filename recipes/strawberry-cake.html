  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The directions for making the cake batter are based on a Duncan HInes Classic Yellow Cake Mix. Follow instructions on
  the box regarding oven temperature, added ingredients, and baking time if using a different brand.</p>
  <h2>ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups crushed fresh strawberries</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin (such as Jell-O)</li>
    <li>3 cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Spread crushed strawberries on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; sprinkle gelatin powder over strawberries, then
    top with mini marshmallows.</li>
    <li>Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened.
    Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter on top of marshmallows.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool cake in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around edges, then turn out the cake onto a serving plate, strawberry
    side up. Store cake in the refrigerator.</li>
